## Overview

The Matrix Manipulation Library is a robust C++ toolkit designed for efficient creation, display, and manipulation of matrices. It offers a wide range of operations from basic arithmetic to advanced computations like LU decomposition and eigenvalue calculation. With its user-friendly command-line interface and comprehensive error handling, this library is suitable for both educational purposes and professional applications.

## Features

- **Flexible Matrix Creation:** Support for various numeric types (int, double, etc.)
- **Visualization:** Easy-to-use console display functionality
- **Comprehensive Operations:**
  - Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
  - Advanced Computations:
    - LU Decomposition
    - Determinant Calculation
    - Matrix Inversion
    - Trace and Transpose
    - Rank Determination
    - Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Computation
- **Robust Error Handling:** Detailed error messages for invalid operations
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly command-line interface for real-time matrix manipulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC 7.0+ recommended)
- CMake (version 3.10+)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-manipulation-library.git
   cd matrix-manipulation-library
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_library
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Matrix

Follow the CLI prompts to create a new matrix:
1. Enter the number of rows
2. Enter the number of columns
3. Provide a name for the matrix
4. Input the matrix elements

### Performing Operations

The CLI offers two types of operations:
1. **Unary Operations:** Actions on a single matrix (e.g., transpose, trace)
2. **Binary Operations:** Actions involving two matrices (e.g., addition, multiplication)

### CLI Menu

```
1. Create a new matrix
2. Print a stored matrix
3. Unary Matrix Operations
4. Binary Matrix Operations
5. Addition of Array of Matrices
6. Exit
```

## Code Examples

### Matrix Creation

```cpp
Matrix<int> matrixA(3, 3, "A");
matrixA.set(0, 0, 1);
matrixA.set(0, 1, 2);
matrixA.set(0, 2, 3);
// ... (populate other elements)
```

### Matrix Operations

```cpp
// Transpose
Matrix<int> transposed = transpose(matrixA);

// Determinant
double det = determinant(matrixA);

// LU Decomposition
auto [L, U] = luDecomposition(matrixA);
```

## Error Handling

The library implements thorough error checking to prevent invalid operations. For instance, attempting to calculate the determinant of a non-square matrix will trigger an appropriate error message.
